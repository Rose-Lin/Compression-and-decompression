Reflection from Eileen and Rose

It took us around 10 hours to finish this assignment. 
This assignment is pretty hard but so interesting that we don't even want to sleep :) The freeing process is easier than that in the last assignment. 
Coming up and building a clear stucture for everthing were hard. Nice assignment and we learned a lot.
